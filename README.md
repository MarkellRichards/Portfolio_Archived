Thank you for viewing my portfolio site and I look forward to any feedback. - Markell Richards

Updates APR2021
Wow it's been quite a year. I made this website as my final project for the Nucamp Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. Since then I have learned a variety of topics and will be doing a complete rehaul of my portfolio site and other projects that are soon coming to Github. I will be leaving this project up to show my roots and how much progression I have made as time moves on. 

New portfolio project in the works and the major differences.

1. TypeScript - I started with strongly typed languages and it helps me to write better code.
2. .Net - My bootcamp had a backend condensed course on NodeJs but as of 2021 I will be focusing more on .NET due to the power of the framework, my love for C#, and job market. I will move back to NodeJs if future employment has that in their stack. New portfolio and its blog subdomain will be served from an aspnet core server. 
3. Optimizing performance - When I first created this site I didn't know much about lighthouse or other tools to test a website performance and how I can optimize it for better load times and SEO. I have quite a bit of refactoring to do because this project load time was terrible, mostly due to me using the largest crisp photos I could find.

More to come!
